# Forms in InterSystems Reports

Recently I needed to create a report using InterSystems Reports, which was not the usual _table_ or a _chart_ report but rather a form. To be specific, a bill (but it does not matter that it was a bill specifically, just that it was not a table or a chart). This article deals with the case where you need to create a report, invoice, bill, or something similar.

I would also describe several tricks, which might be helpful. This article assumes familiarity with InterSystems Reports Designer. Check out [Getting Started with InterSystems Reports](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?id=1538) if you want to learn the basics of creating reports in InterSystems Reports Designer.

# Running the example

If you want to get a running demo, you can start this project in [Docker](https://github.com/eduard93/reports). If you want to run this demo on host, follow these steps:

1. Load `iris.xml` into InterSystems IRIS
2. Execute:

```
do ##class(report.Client).Populate()
do ##class(report.Orders).Populate()
```
3. Create a new folder and place `report.cat.xml` and `reportset.cls.xml` there.
4. In `report.cat.xml` modify `JDBCConnection` to connect to an InterSystems IRIS instance in (1).
5. Open `report.cat.xml` connection in InterSystems Reports Designer (version 18.2 or later).
6. Open `reportset.cls.xml` report in InterSystems Reports Designer.

# Report types

First, let's talk about different report types. While this is my own taxonomy, having done several PoCs using InterSystems Reports, I arrived at the following three report types:

1. Table reports. The most straightforward report type, table report, is, essentially, a result of a query execution piped into a pdf or excel file. They are created for the two main purposes: to denote a state of a database at some specific point of time OR to be a base for some ad-hoc analysis. Analysis can be done entirely by the consumer, or parts of the analysis (grouping, filtering, preliminary calculations, etc.) can be offloaded to the reports server.
3. Chart reports. Unlike table reports, which are one query per a report, chart reports use one query per chart, so there are a lot of independent queries. Chart reports are used for visualization in a case where we don't want a user to modify it (unlike BI tools where base dashboard/widget usually IS modifiable by the end-user - at least to some extent).
4. Form reports. This is a more challenging report type combining one basic query and several related subqueries. If you want to create a bill, invoice, or something similar - you'll need a form report. 

# Data model

The main difference with the data model (compared to the typical table or chart report) is that you need to use queries of a different cardinality together.
In our example, we will use two tables - customers and orders. We will create a billing report, where each customer has a separate bill with a varying number of orders.

Here's our data model. First, we have a client:

```objectscript
Class report.Client Extends %Persistent
{

Property Name As %String;

Property Address As %VarString;

/// Client account number in some billing system
Property BillingOptionA As %Integer;

/// Client account number in another billing system
Property BillingOptionB As %Integer;
}
```

Note that client has two billing options - accounts in external billing systems (for example, banks or something similar). When we generate a report, we want to show only billing options available to a client (a client can have only one billing option, for example).

Next, there are orders - each client has a random number of orders to include in a bill: 

```objectscript
Class report.Orders Extends %Persistent
{

Property Client As Client;

Property Item As %String;

Property Amount As %Integer;
}
```

The form report we want to produce is one bill per client listing his billing information and all orders.

So to start with, we need to create one base query (Clients) and one subquery (Orders). Since there are no connections, just add a whole table as a query.

# Initial work

1. Create `Clients` and `Orders` queries:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156050298-849f7a59-60c6-4e27-82a1-f8bd5e445c6d.png)

2. Create a new report of a `Banded `type:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156051275-d99acb48-8149-44b6-96db-c26e7c0d32ec.png)

3. Choose `Clients` query as a data source and add all properties:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156051517-7bddbe37-3ac3-44b0-a0c7-0029d7777085.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156051602-c7c2c222-cb7f-4f8a-a1eb-b3a6d5cb9792.png)

4. Your report should look something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156051668-341def38-15c6-4232-b6dd-c8ab2a27f8ae.png)

Or displayed:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156051735-efb623b4-2c51-4ab7-8a48-69652252515d.png)

5. Let's reformat it a little to make it look more like a bill and also hide the `ID` column:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156052803-f43a2ffd-3af6-4b7c-9918-959f6e54a462.png)

Our report starts looking like a bill:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156052915-15f29bf1-7ca2-4710-b39a-0a75b74f4341.png)

# Connecting item queries

Now we need to add orders to our bill. Add a new Table (Group Left) to the banded object. Choose `Orders` dataset:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156054658-8b68dbfe-cac3-4290-906e-72645db06754.png)

New table inside the banded object:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156054760-17032186-f1ab-4332-a5b0-8e44b4ca6ab0.png)

But if you display it as is, it would show all orders for every client. To prevent that, press üñ±Ô∏è RMB on the orders table and choose `Data Container Link...` option:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156055374-b5d3d4f6-1ff0-41ba-8420-9a07bdd47a08.png)

In there link Client ID and Order Client:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156055465-09f3a22b-ccd3-4a68-9bf3-79f853c4d4aa.png)

Now our bill displays only Orders for a current client:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156055557-a3e5d0ed-93e0-4901-b434-da4e6ff30426.png)

That's pretty much it. Next, let's discuss some tricks.

# Formulas

Formulas are a powerful instrument allowing arbitrary computations over base query properties. 

## Builtins

Users can set most properties to formulas as opposed to constants. For example, our client may have only one billing option, and we need to hide a corresponding QR code if the billing option value is empty. To do that, set `Invisible` property to `IsNull(@BillingOptionB)` (press `Fx` to enter a formula, [list of supported functions](https://reportkbase.logianalytics.com/designer16/userguide/index.htm#t=HTML%2Fappendix%2Fapdx_fctn.htm), but a complete, version-specific list is available in Formula wizard):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156154786-801b250f-cea1-4c6d-a494-28938b7fceb5.png)

This way, if the value of `BillingOptionB` is null (or empty string as the case may be), the QR code is not displayed at all.

## Custom

Next, let's align the `Address` string to take more space if the `BillingOptionB` QR code is not displayed. There's no ready-made function for that, so we need to write our own. The language of choice here is Java. Press `<New Formula...>` button and create a new formula named `WidthFormula` with this code `if (IsNull(@BillingOptionB)) then return 3.72 else return 2.72`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156157740-891261af-8c76-47e9-8da5-657a37873d48.png)

And set it as a Width value in address:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156166662-c6c36d97-68d9-4382-ba92-9acbe4adfcd1.png)

Now render for ClientA and ClientB would look like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156166730-b76d9ecf-7b7f-4661-8d3e-b8ff2aeba68d.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156166754-148a78d1-ca3d-406a-a4bd-03845e62e4af.png)

Note that the address now takes all available space.

# Several tables

What if we need two tables, one after the other? In that case, we need to add another Detail Panel. Press üñ±Ô∏è RMB on the existing Detail panel and click `Insert Panel After`. 
After that, add a table to a second Detail Panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5127457/156169355-81e5f9dd-1925-4ed0-8dec-7a1f7f58777c.png)

Tables do not overlap:

# Vertical text

If you want to add vertical text (actually any non-horizontal text), do it by adding a UDO component of a JRptator type:

And set its `Rotate` property to `-90`:
