# Native API for Python 

InterSystems [Native SDK for Python](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=BPYNAT_about) is a lightweight interface to  InterSystems IRIS APIs that were once available only through ObjectScript.

I'm especially interested in the ability to call ObjectScript methods, class methods, to be precise. It works, and it works great, but by default, calls only support scalar arguments: strings, booleans, integers, and floats. 

But if you want to:
- Pass or return structures, such as dicts or lists
- Pass or return streams

You'll need to write some glue code or take this [project](https://github.com/eduard93/edpy) (installs with `pip install edpy`). `edpy` package gives you one simple signature:

```python
call(iris, class_name, method_name, args)
```

which allows you to call any ObjectScript method and get results back.  Import it like this:

```python
from edpy import iris
```

`call` accepts 4 required arguments:
- `iris` - a reference to an established [IRIS object](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=BPYNAT_refapi#BPYNAT_refapi_class-iris)
- `class_name` - IRIS class to call
- `method_name` - IRIS method to call
- `args` - list of 0 or more arguments

## Arguments

Each argument can be one of:

- string (any length, if larger than `$$$MaxStringLength` or 3641144 symbols, it would be automatically converted into a stream
- boolean
- integer
- float
- dict (converts into a dynamic object)
- list or tuple (converts into a dynamic array)

dict, list, and tuple arguments can recursively contain other dicts, lists, and tuples (while memory lasts).

## Return value

In return, we expect either a dynamic object/array or a JSON string/stream. In that case, edpy would first convert it into a Python string and, if possible, interpret it as a Python dict or list. Otherwise, the result would be returned to the caller as is.

That's about it, but let me give you some examples of ObjectScript methods and how to call them using this Python function.

## Example 1: Pong

```objectscript
ClassMethod Test(arg1, arg2, arg3) As %DynamicArray
{
	return [(arg1), (arg2), (arg3)]
}
```

Call with:

```
>>> iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test", [1, 1.2, "ABC"])
[1, 1.2, 'ABC']
```

No surprise here. Arguments are packed back into an array and returned to the caller.

## Example 2: Properties


```objectscript
ClassMethod Test2(arg As %DynamicObject) As %String
{
	return arg.Prop
}
```

Call like this:

```
>>> iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test2", [{"Prop":123}])
123
```

Now for a more embedded invocation:

```
>>> iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test2", [{"Prop":{"Prop2":123}}])
{'Prop2': 123}
```

If a property is too long that's also okay - streams will be used to send it to IRIS and/or back:

```
ret = iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test2", [{"Prop":"A" * 10000000}])
>>> len(ret)
10000000
```

If you need guaranteed streams on the InterSystems IRIS side, you can use [%Get](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/documatic/%25CSP.Documatic.cls?&LIBRARY=%25SYS&CLASSNAME=%25Library.DynamicObject#%25Get):

```objectscript
set stream = arg.%Get("Prop",,"stream")
```

If the stream is base64 encoded you can automatically decode it with:

```objectscript
set stream = arg.%Get("Prop",,"stream<base64")
```

## Example 3: String or Stream

```objectscript
ClassMethod Test3(arg As %Stream.Object) As %String
{
	set file = ##class(%Stream.FileCharacter).%New()
	set file.TranslateTable = "UTF8"
	set filename = ##class(%File).ManagerDirectory() _ "test.txt"
	do file.LinkToFile(filename)
	if $isObject(arg) {
		set sc = file.CopyFromAndSave(arg)
	} else {
		do file.Write(arg)
		set sc = file.%Save()
	}
	if $$$ISERR(sc) {
		set jsonret = {"status":0, "payload":($system.Status.GetErrorText(sc))}
	} else {
		set jsonret = {"status":1}
	}
	quit jsonret.%ToJSON()
}
```

Here we write either a string or a stream to `<mgr>test.txt`.

```
>>> iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test3", ["ðŸ™‚"])
{'status': 1}
```

And if I open the file I'll see one ðŸ™‚ and not two `??` - so we preserve encoding.

```
>>> iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test3", ["ðŸ™‚" * 10000000])
{'status': 1}
```

I'll omit the file output for brevity, but it's there.


Finally, by passing a dynamic object or array inside, you can avoid string/stream dichotomy altogether, even if you don't know if the property would be shorter or longer than the string limit. In that case, you can always get your suspect property like a stream.

## Example 4: Return streams

```objectscript
ClassMethod Test4(arg As %DynamicArray) As %String
{
	return arg.%Get(0)
}
```

Here's how that looks like:

```
>>> ret = iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test4", [["ðŸ™‚" * 10000000]])
>>> len(ret)
10000000
>>> ret[:5]
'ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚'
```

## One more thing

There's also a `get_iris(ip="localhost", port=1972, namespace="USER", username="_SYSTEM", password="SYS")` function which gets you a working IRIS object. 
So here's a complete example, if you want to try it yourself:

First load the [User.Py class](https://gist.github.com/eduard93/bbc62dbfa3981b5a201e178f61a17572) and install `edpy` python library:

```bash
pip install edpy
```

And then in python call:

```python
from edpy import iris
iris_native = iris.get_iris()
iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test",  [1, 1.2, "ABC"])
iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test2", [{"Prop":123}])
iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test2", [{"Prop":{"Prop2":123}}])
ret2 = iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test2", [{"Prop":"A" * 10000000}])
iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test3", ["ðŸ™‚"])
iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test3", ["ðŸ™‚" * 10000000])
ret4 = iris.call(iris_native, "User.Py", "Test4", [["ðŸ™‚" * 10000000]])
```

# Conclusion

Native SDK for Python is a powerful tool, allowing you complete and unrestricted access to InterSystems IRIS. I hope this project can save you some time marshaling  InterSystems IRIS calls. Is there some combination of method arguments it does not support? If so, share in the comments how you call them.
