After almost 4 years this article series is back! During these years I have been working with several InterSystems clients, developing CI/CD pipelines for very different use cases, so I hope the information, presented in this article would be useful to someone.

We have an exciting range of topics to cover: first let's talk about things beyond the code - namely configurations and data.

In this [series of articles](https://community.intersystems.com/post/continuous-delivery-your-intersystems-solution-using-gitlab-index), I'd like to present and discuss several possible approaches toward software development with InterSystems technologies and GitLab. 

# Issue

Previously we discussed code promotions and that was, in a way, stateless - we always go from a (presumably) empty instance to a ful codebase. But sometimes we need to provide data. There are different data types:

- Configuration: users, web apps, LUTs, custom schemas, 
- Settings: environment-specific key-value pairs
- Data: reference tables and such often must be provided for your  app to work
